	* mono-gdb.py: Remove the --64 argument to as, it is not needed.
	
	* mono-gdb.py (stringify_class_name): Helper function to print base types
	using their short name. Also add a prototype implementation of registering
	the hooks from python code instead of needing the mono-gdbinit file.

	* gdb-python.diff: Changes against the gdb archer branch at 
	http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PythonGdb to fix some problems/add functionality.

	* mono-gdbinit: Hook into backtrace as hook-stop seems to crash gdb
	* mono-gdb.py: Find the gdbinit name from the executable name instead of
	hardcoding mono

	* mono-gdb.py mono-gdbinit: Support files to help debugging mono/mono apps
	using a python enabled gdb.
