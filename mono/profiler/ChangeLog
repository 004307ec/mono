	 * mono-profiler-oprofile.c (gc_event): Fix deadlock condition.

2008-04-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-oprofile.c (write_current_block): Added an incremental
	 "counter delta" field to the block header, so that each block has a
	 timestamp directly in the header.
	 This will allow tools to know when a block has been emitted without
	 decoding (even without reading) the block contents.
	 So, if the user is only interested in blocks emitted in a certain
	 time interval, the tool can seek into the file instead of reading the
	 block contents.
	 Of course this breaks the file format, but at this stage we can still
	 do it, and... better now than later.

2008-04-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c (profiler_heap_scan): removed debugging code
	and therefore removed unconditional inclusion of signal.h (it is now
	included anyway on Unix platforms).

2008-04-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c: Added possibiliy of requesting heap
	snapshots with a signal (like heap-shot).

2008-04-02  Rodrigo Kumpera <rkumpera@novell.com>

	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix the arm build. G_BREAKPOINT() does
	a "raise(SIGTRAL)" and in some platforms <signal.h> must be included.

2008-03-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c: Added option to append a suffix to the
	default file name.

2008-03-27  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c: setup_user_options: set default log file
	name to the name of the executed application.

2008-03-26  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* Makefile.am: enabled the logging profiler on Linux.

2008-03-26  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c: Attach and detach the writer thread.

2008-03-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c: Fixed bug with memory region indexes.

2008-03-18  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c:
	OPEN_FILE(): Fixed file creation.
	[UN]LOCK_PROFILER(): Removed logging message.

2008-03-11  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c: Fixed heap profiler, added a new way to
	get the symbol names for unmanaged functions, and fixed lots of bugs.

2008-01-08  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-oprofile.c: First code drop of new logging profiler
	(and shamefully forgot to set HAS_OPROFILE to 0...).
	* Makefile.am: Added logging profiler, but commented in out to avoid
	breaking the build on Windows.

2005-07-25  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* mono-cov.c: Applied patch from Iain McCoy (iain@mccoy.id.au). Fixes
	#75619.

2003-11-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* mono-cov.c: Change default assembly name to mscorlib.dll
	
Tue Jul 1 11:26:10 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: added.

Mon Jun 16 18:21:26 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* mono-cov.c: coverage profiler.
