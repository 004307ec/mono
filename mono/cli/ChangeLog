	* loader.c: forgot to insert the method in the cache, not nice
	with a recursive fibonacci test case :-)

	* class.c: updates to match changes in metadata.
	Fix off by one errors. Implement creation of classes by typeref.
	Remove custom cache and use the class cache in MonoImage.
	* cli.h, loader.c: add MonoImage field to MonoMethod. Fill method cache
	in MonoImage. Updates to match changes in metadata.

	* class.c (mono_class_create_from_typedef): Take into account
	parent classes for the size of a structure. 

	Still not ideal, but better than before.

	For the case of the interpreter, Paolo is right, there is not much
	use for a Field Map, as the way the Fields are located is through
	a token.

	(mono_class_init): Remove, initialize automatically.

	(mono_class_get_field): new function, returns the information
	about a field given a class and its token.

	* object.h, object.c, class.h, class.c: Implemented the beginning
	of the object system. x
