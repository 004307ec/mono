	* class.c (mono_class_create_from_typedef): Take into account
	parent classes for the size of a structure. 

	Still not ideal, but better than before.

	For the case of the interpreter, Paolo is right, there is not much
	use for a Field Map, as the way the Fields are located is through
	a token.

	(mono_class_init): Remove, initialize automatically.

	(mono_class_get_field): new function, returns the information
	about a field given a class and its token.
