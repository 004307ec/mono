	* interp.c (ves_exec_method): Make the interpreter abort with more
	information than it currently does.

	Enable the slow processor, as it is easier to debug.

	* Started changelog.
	* interp.c: use new mono_get_method () function to get the complete
	info on a method invocation: we support now method invocation with
	multiple (or zero) simple arguments and with or without a return value.
	Implement also a couple more opcodes.
