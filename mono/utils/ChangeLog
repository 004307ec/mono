	* monobitset.c: use memcmp instead of memcpy

Thu May 9 17:23:17 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* monobitset.c, monibitset.h: bit set data structure.
	Not included in the build yet because the jit has some symbol clashes
	with it.

	* First checkin: libmonoutils is meant to hold some utility
	data structures and bits that are usefult to the rest of the project
	and don't require metadata/runtime support.
	mono-hash is a GC-safe hash table: i.e. you can store GC-allocated
	data in it.
