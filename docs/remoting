Runtime support for Remoting
============================

The runtime supports a special objects called "TransparentProxy". You can
create objects of this type by calling GetTransparentProxy() on a "RealProxy"
object. 

LDFLD/STFLD for transparent proxies
===================================

Access to fields must be redirected to the remote object. System.Object has
some special methods for that:

void FieldGetter (string typeName, string fieldName, ref object val);
		
void FieldSetter (string typeName, string fieldName, object val);

This methods are never called on actual object. The are only used to pack
LDFLD/STFLD operations into method call messages, which are then passed to the
RealProxy::Invoke() method. 

There are two helper methods which can be used by the JIT and the interpreter
to convert LDFLD/STFLD operations into messages and then call
RealProxy::Invoke(): mono_store_remote_field() and mono_load_remote_field().
