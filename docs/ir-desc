Operation: OP_LOCALLOC
	inst_left:
		The value 
                                ins->inst_left = *sp;
                                ins->cil_code = ip;

	This is the equivalent of alloca() in a C implementation: it
	allocates a bunch of bytes on the stack dynamically. Local
	variables are allocated statically in the stack instead.
	
	It is implemented by moving the stack pointer according to the
	platform ABI: you may need to keep a specific frame register
	to address local variables when LOCALLOC is used (the PPC code
	does this, for example: ifyou're doing the s390 port I suggest
	starting from that)

Operation: OP_CALL_HANDLER.

	cil_code: 
		Points to the CIL where the LEAVE or LEAVE_S
		instruction was found.

	inst_target_bb:
		The target basic block for this invocation.

	This instruction must call the target basic block.
