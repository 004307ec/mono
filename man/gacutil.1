.TH gacutil "Mono 1.0"
.SH NAME
gacutil \- Global Asssembly Cache management utility.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B gacutil [-user] [command] [options] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIgacutil\fP is a tool used by developers to install assemblies into
the system Global Assembly Cache (GAC) to become part of the
assemblies that are available for all applications at runtime.
.PP
Notice that they are not directly available to the compiler, the
convention is that assemblies must also be placed in a separate
directory for being accessed to the compiler.  This is done with the
-package directive to gacutil.
.PP
The tool allows for installationl, removal, and listing of the
contents of the assembly cache.
.PP
The GAC is relative to the Mono installation prefix:
mono_prefix/lib/mono.
.SH FLAGS
The "-user" flag enables you to install/remove the assembly into the
user's assembly cache, as opposed to the global one.
.PP
.SH COMMANDS
.I "-i path_to_assembly" [-f] [-root ROOTDIR] [-package NAME]
.Sp
The above installs the assembly into the GAC, use the -f flag to force
an installation an overwrite anything in there.  
.Sp
The -package option can be used to also create a directory in in
prefix/lib/mono with the name NAME, and a symlink is created from
NAME/assembly_name to the assembly on the GAC.  This is used so
developers can reference a set of libraries at once.
.Sp
The -root option is used by developers integrating this with automake
tools or packaging tools that require a prefix directory to be
specified.  The root represents the "libdir" component of a prefix
(typically prefix/lib).  
.fi
.PP
.I "-l"
.Sp
Lists the contents of the Global Assembly Cache
.PP
.I "-u assembly_name [-root]"
.Sp
The above removes the given assembly name from the Global Assembly
Cache.  As opposed to the install option that takes a filename, this
takes as an argument the assembly name, which looks like this:
.nf
	MyLibrary.Something, version=1.0.0.0, publicKeyToken=xxxx,culture=neutral
.fi
.Sp
Notice that you can have spaces in the command line, there is no need
to quote them.
.Sp
The removal performs a greedy removal, if you only specifiy one
component like, "MyLibrary.Something", it will remove all versions of
the library.
.SH FILES
On Unix assemblies are loaded from the installation lib directory.  If you set
`prefix' to /usr, the assemblies will be located in /usr/lib.  On
Windows, the assemblies are loaded from the directory where mono and
mint live.
.PP
/etc/mono/config, ~/.mono/config
.PP
Mono runtime configuration file.  See the mono-config(5) manual page
for more information.
