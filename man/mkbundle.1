.SH NAME
mkbundle \- Creates a bundled executable.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B mkbundle [options] assembly1 [assembly2 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fImkbundle\fP generates an executable program that will contain
static copies of the assemblies listed on the command line.  By
default only the assemblies specified in the command line will be
included in the bundle.  To automatically include all of the
dependencies referenced, use the "--deps" command line option.
.PP
For example, to create a bundle for hello world, use the following
command:
.nf
	$ mkbundle -o hello hello.exe
.fi
.PP
The above will pull hello.exe native program called "hello".  Notice
that the produced image still contains the CIL image and no
precompilation is done.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-L path"
Adds the `path' do the search list for assemblies.  The rules are the
same as for the compiler -lib: or -L flags.
.TP
.I  "--nodeps"
This is the default: mkbundle will only include the assemblies that
were specified on the command line to reduce the size of the resulting
image created.
.TP
.I "--deps"
This option will bundle all of the referenced assemblies for the
assemblies listed on the command line option.  This is useful to
distribute a self-contained image.
.TP
.I "--keeptemp"
By default mkbundle will delete the temporary files that it uses to
produce the bundle.  This option keeps the file around.
.SH FILES
This program will load referenced assemblies from the Mono assembly
cache.
