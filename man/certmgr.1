.B WARNING: This details the current behavior of Mono and could change between releases.
The only safe way to interact with certificate stores is to use the certmgr
tool. The current releases of Mono keeps all the user certificate stores in 
separates directories under
.I ~/.mono/certs/
.TP
For example the trusted root certificates for a user would be kept under
.I ~/.mono/certs/Trust/
.TP
Certificates files are kept in DER (binary) format (extension .cer).
.TP
The filenames either starts with
.I tbp 
(thumbprint) or
.I ski
(subject key identifier).
.TP
The rest of the filename is the base64-encoded value (tbp or ski).
